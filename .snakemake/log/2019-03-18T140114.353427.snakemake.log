MissingOutputException in line 799 of /Users/katekistler/nextstrain/egg-passage/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
plots/h3n2_ha_12y_fra/genetic_background_heatmap_h3n2_ha_12y_fra.pdf
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Removing output files of failed job plot_background since they might be corrupted:
plots/h3n2_ha_12y_fra/genetic_background_kkclade_heatmap_h3n2_ha_12y_fra.pdf
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
